## Monetisation & flywheel (theory)

**Revenue:** Paid custom briefs (briefing product). That’s the money.

**Two loops we rely on:**

### 1. Acquisition loop

**Free (daily brief, daily question) → habit → trial → paid briefs.**

- Daily brief is free and shows what can be done.
- Daily question is free (no signup) and builds habit.
- We encourage people who see the value to create their own paid briefs (trial → paid).
- Free is the top of funnel; paid briefs are the monetisation layer.

### 2. Value loop

**Participation (discussions, daily question) → more data, better briefs, more credibility → more readers → more converters.**

- Discussions and daily question participation build data and engagement.
- That improves the product (better briefs, more trust).
- More readers and participants → more people who might convert to paid briefs.
- Paid briefs create stickiness; some paid users also participate, which strengthens the value loop.

**How to test the theory**

- **Acquisition:** Are trial starts coming from people who already read the daily brief or answer the daily question? Track: brief readers → trial → paid.
- **Value:** Is participation mostly from free users or paid users? Track: daily question votes and discussion participation by free vs paid. If participation is mostly free, the story is “free habit drives value; paid monetises it.” If paid users participate a lot, “paid briefs drive engagement” is also true.
- **Don’t starve the free side:** Free is the funnel and (with data + habit) the moat. Optimise conversion without under-investing in the free loop.

## Defensibility

- **Not the moat:** Algorithm (open, pol.is-style), code (AGPL).
- **The moat:** Longitudinal public belief data (daily question + discussions over time), distribution (brief + daily habit), embedded use (teams/orgs).
