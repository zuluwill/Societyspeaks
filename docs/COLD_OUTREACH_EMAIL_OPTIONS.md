# Cold Outreach Email Options for Society Speaks

## Key Principle (From ChatGPT Analysis)

**Never lead with how it works. Lead with what it reveals.**

- Describe outputs, not methods
- Match how Pol.is feels, not how it's implemented
- Don't require prior knowledge
- Avoid academic jargon ("probability-based calibration", "structured public calibration")
- Remove technical terms upfront ("machine learning" - explain later if needed)

---

## Current Version (Analysis)

**Subject:** Making Disagreement Useful Again

**Body:**
> Society Speaks turns noise into signal. We use machine learning to find where people actually agree, reveal bridge ideas that unite opposing groups, and surface genuine divisions worth addressing.

### What Works:
- ✅ Describes outputs (agreement, bridge ideas, divisions)
- ✅ Tagline is strong and memorable
- ✅ Doesn't require prior knowledge
- ✅ Matches how Pol.is feels

### What to Fix:
- ❌ "machine learning" - too technical upfront (remove or move later)
- ⚠️ "turns noise into signal" - slightly abstract but acceptable
- ⚠️ Missing low-commitment entry point (Daily Question)
- ⚠️ Could be more specific about target audience

### ChatGPT's Revised Core Description (Recommended Anchor):

**Making Disagreement Useful Again**

Society Speaks turns noise into signal.

Instead of comment threads or polls, we analyse patterns in how people respond to the same questions to show:
- where people actually agree
- which ideas bridge opposing groups
- where divisions are real and persistent

The result is a clearer picture of public belief — without outrage or performative debate.

**Why this works:**
- Removes "machine learning" (explain later if asked)
- Uses "analyse patterns" instead of technical terms
- Focuses on outputs, not methods
- Instantly legible to non-technical people

## ChatGPT's Email Templates (Recommended Starting Point)

### For Journalists / Newsletter Writers

**Subject:** A different way to look at disagreement

**Body:**
> Hi {{Name}},
>
> I'm working on a small public experiment called Society Speaks.
>
> It looks at disagreement differently.
>
> Instead of polls or comment threads, we analyse patterns in how people respond to the same questions to show:
> - where people quietly agree
> - which ideas bridge opposing groups
> - where divisions are real and persistent
>
> The goal is to turn noisy public debate into something more usable — especially during moments of uncertainty.
>
> It's early, but we publish a public weekly brief that some journalists and researchers are finding useful as a sense-making reference.
>
> No pitch — just sharing in case it's relevant to your work.
>
> Best,
> Will

**Why this works:**
- No jargon
- No "machine learning" upfront
- Instantly legible

### For Analysts / Policy Researchers

**Subject:** Understanding disagreement beyond traditional polling

**Body:**
> Hi {{Name}},
>
> We're running a public experiment to understand disagreement beyond traditional polling or open debate.
>
> Using structured questions, we analyse patterns in responses to identify:
> - overlapping beliefs across groups
> - ideas that act as bridges
> - divisions that don't easily move
>
> It produces a different kind of public signal — less about who's loudest, more about how beliefs actually cluster and shift.
>
> The outputs are public and still early, but I thought it might be relevant to your work.
>
> Best,
> Will

**Why this works:**
- Still rigorous
- No forecasting jargon
- Frames this as signal infrastructure
- Appropriate for analytical audience

### For Educators

**Subject:** A tool for exploring disagreement without debate

**Body:**
> Hi {{Name}},
>
> I've built a free public tool that helps groups explore disagreement without debates or comment threads.
>
> Students respond to structured statements, and the system shows:
> - where views overlap
> - where they diverge
> - which ideas bridge groups
>
> Some lecturers are using it as a seminar prompt to move discussions beyond "for vs against" and into evidence and reasoning.
>
> If that's useful for your teaching, I'm happy to share an example.
>
> Best,
> Will

**Why this works:**
- Maps perfectly to Pol.is's educational use cases
- Clear, practical application
> - Low-pressure ask

## Alternative Options (Refined Based on ChatGPT's Principles)

### Option 1: Problem-Focused (Best for Policymakers/Civic Leaders)

**Subject:** Where Do People Actually Agree? (Hint: It's Not Where You Think)

**Body:**
> Social platforms make society appear more divided than it really is. Traditional polls are shallow. Comment sections are noisy.

>
> **How it works:** Instead of comment threads or polls, we analyse patterns in how people respond to the same questions.
>
> **What you get:**
> - Consensus statements (broad agreement across groups)
> - Bridge ideas (unite different opinion clusters—most actionable for progress)
> - Genuine divisions (honest fault lines where deeper work is needed)
>
> **Try it:** Start with today's Daily Question (2 minutes). See how others responded, then explore deeper discussions.
>
> [Try Today's Question →](https://societyspeaks.io/daily)

## Option 4: Curiosity-Driven (Best for Journalists/Researchers)

**Subject:** What If Disagreement Could Actually Be Useful?

>
> **The Daily Question:** One question per day, 2 minutes to respond. See how others voted, then explore deeper discussions on important topics.
>
> **Structured participation:** Instead of comment chaos, we analyse patterns in how people respond to structured statements—revealing natural opinion clusters without labels or bias.

## Key Principles (From ChatGPT + Refinements)

1. **Lead with what it reveals, not how it works**
   - Describe outputs (agreement, bridge ideas, divisions)
   - Explain methods later (on site, or if asked)

2. **Remove technical jargon upfront**
   - ❌ "machine learning" (move to "How it works" page)
   - ❌ "probability-based calibration"
   - ❌ "structured public calibration"
   - ✅ "analyse patterns in how people respond"

3. **Concrete benefits** - Specific outputs (consensus, bridge, divisive statements)

4. **Low-commitment entry** - Daily Question (2 minutes) as hook (when appropriate)

5. **Target audience specificity** - Tailor to journalists, policymakers, educators, etc.

6. **Social proof** - "Used by..." or "Some journalists/researchers find useful"

7. **Clear CTAs** - Specific next steps (but keep low-pressure)

8. **Problem-first** - Addresses the pain point (outrage-driven platforms, noisy debate)

## When (and Where) to Explain Mechanics

**Don't explain in cold outreach.** Explain later:
- "How it works" page on site
- Short diagram/visual explanation
- Footnote in briefing
- Response email when someone shows interest

**Example phrasing (for later, not upfront):**
> "We use clustering techniques similar to Pol.is to group people by patterns of agreement rather than ideology."

That's enough for credibility without overload.

Your instinct was right - the idea resonates, the mechanism is elegant, the language just needed grounding in human terms. You don't need to oversimplify. You just need to describe the experience, not the algorithm.
