Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly in an issue.

Please report security issues privately using one of these channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred):
   - https://github.com/zuluwill/Societyspeaks/security/advisories/new
2. Private contact details listed in `SECURITY.md`

Public issue reports may be converted to a private report or closed to protect users.
