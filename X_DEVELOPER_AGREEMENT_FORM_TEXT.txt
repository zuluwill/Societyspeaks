Society Speaks (societyspeaks.io) is a public discussion platform that facilitates civic debate and consensus-building. We use X's API v2 exclusively to automatically post announcements about new public discussions to promote civic engagement.

USE CASES:
1. Automated posting of discussion announcements - When new public discussions are created on our platform (from trending news topics or user-generated content), we automatically post brief announcements to X (@societyspeaksio) that include the discussion topic, a link to our platform, and relevant hashtags.

2. Rate-limited scheduling - We implement strict rate limiting (max 15 posts/day, 500/month) and schedule posts at optimal times throughout the day to respect API limits and avoid overwhelming followers.

DATA USAGE:
- We only POST content using the create_tweet endpoint
- We do NOT read, fetch, or analyze any X user data, tweets, profiles, or timelines
- We do NOT resell any data from X API
- We only store tweet IDs in our database to prevent duplicate posts and track our own posting history

PURPOSE:
To promote civic engagement by helping people discover important public discussions about current events, politics, policy, and social issues, and to direct X users to participate in structured, nuanced discussions on our platform.

TECHNICAL:
- API: POST /2/tweets via Tweepy library
- Auth: OAuth 1.0a
- Account: @societyspeaksio
- No data collection from X - only posting our own content
