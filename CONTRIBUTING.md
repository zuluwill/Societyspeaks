# Contributing to Society Speaks

Thanks for your interest in improving Society Speaks.

## Current Maintainer Status

Society Speaks is currently maintained by one person: William Roberts.

External pull requests are paused for now while core roadmap and product direction are actively evolving.

You can still contribute right now by:

- Opening issues for bugs and regressions
- Suggesting product, UX, and documentation improvements
- Sharing security concerns privately (see `SECURITY.md`)
- Proposing partnership and publisher integration ideas

## When Pull Requests Reopen

When external pull requests are reopened, this workflow will apply:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. Keep changes small, focused, and easy to review.
4. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
5. Update documentation for user-facing or operational changes.
6. Open a pull request using the repository template.

### Expected standards

- Follow existing project patterns and naming conventions.
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, or production credentials.
- Prefer clear commit messages describing why the change is needed.
- Be respectful and constructive in all discussions.

## Licensing

This codebase is licensed under `AGPL-3.0`.

By submitting a contribution after pull requests reopen, you agree that your contribution can be distributed under the repository license at that time unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.
