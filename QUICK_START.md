# 🚀 Quick Start - Apply Migration Now!

**Status:** All code complete. Ready to deploy in 2 commands.

---

## ⚡ Quick Deploy (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify Database Connection

On Replit, your `DATABASE_URL` should be automatically set. Verify:

```bash
# Check if DATABASE_URL exists
echo $DATABASE_URL

# If it shows a PostgreSQL connection string, you're good!
# If not, check Replit Secrets (🔒 icon in sidebar)
```

---

### Step 2: Apply the Migration

```bash
# Run this command:
python3 -m flask db upgrade

# Expected output:
# INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
# INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
# INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 294c806bafa6 -> c1a2b3c4d5e6, add native statement system phase 1
```

**That's it! You're done!** 🎉

## 🧪 Test It Right Away

### Create Your First Native Discussion

**Option 1: Via Web (Recommended)**

1. Start your app: `python3 run.py`
2. Navigate to `/discussions/create`
3. ✅ **Check the green "Use Native Statement System" checkbox**
4. Fill in:
   - Title: "Test Our New Debate System"
   - Description: "Testing the pol.is-inspired native features"
   - Topic: Technology
   - Scope: Global
5. Click Next → Skip embed → Fill details → Submit!

**Option 2: Via Flask Shell (Quick)**

```bash
python3 -m flask shell
```

```python
from app import db
from app.models import Discussion, User

# Get your user
user = User.query.first()

# Create test discussion
test = Discussion(
    title="Native Debate Test",
    description="Testing our new system",
    has_native_statements=True,  # KEY FLAG
    embed_code=None,
    topic="Technology",
    geographic_scope="global",
    creator_id=user.id,
    individual_profile_id=user.individual_profile.id if user.profile_type == 'individual' else None
)

db.session.add(test)
db.session.commit()

print(f"✅ Created: /discussions/{test.id}/{test.slug}")
exit()
```

## ✅ Quick Test Checklist

Visit your new native discussion and verify:

- [ ] Page loads (no errors)
- [ ] Green statement form shows (when logged in)
- [ ] Can post a statement (10-500 chars)
- [ ] Three vote buttons appear: 👍 Agree | 👎 Disagree | ❓ Unsure
- [ ] Vote counts update instantly (no page reload)
- [ ] Sort dropdown works (5 options)
- [ ] Character counter works (0/500)

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### "DATABASE_URL not set"

```bash
# On Replit: Check Secrets panel (🔒 icon)
# Should see DATABASE_URL there
# If not, enable PostgreSQL in Replit
```

### "No such command 'db'"

```bash
# Flask-Migrate might not be installed
python3 -m pip install Flask-Migrate==4.0.0 --user
python3 -m flask db upgrade
```

### "Table already exists"

```bash
# Check if migration already ran
python3 -m flask db current

# If shows c1a2b3c4d5e6, you're already migrated!
# Just test the system
```

### Migration succeeds but can't see native UI

1. Check database: `psql $DATABASE_URL`
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, has_native_statements FROM discussion LIMIT 5;
   ```
2. Make sure `has_native_statements = true` for your test discussion
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## 📊 What Was Created

The migration just created:

**7 New Tables:**

- `statement` - User-submitted claims/questions
- `statement_vote` - Vote data for clustering
- `response` - Threaded responses (Phase 2)
- `evidence` - Source citations (Phase 2)
- `consensus_analysis` - Clustering results (Phase 3)
- `statement_flag` - Moderation flags
- `user_api_key` - LLM API keys (Phase 4)

**Updated Tables:**

- `discussion` - Added `has_native_statements` column, made `embed_code` nullable

**All tables have:**

- Proper indexes for performance
- Foreign key constraints
- Unique constraints where needed
